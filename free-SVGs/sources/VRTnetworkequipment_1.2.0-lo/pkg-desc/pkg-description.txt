A library of consistently-styled isometric symbols for creating network diagrams (logical and physical) in vector form. Shapes are designed to scale and can have line width and style applied in bulk (select all) without breaking the appearance. In addition to traditional IT-related euipment, the library includes equipment encountered in industrial environments such as PLCs, RTUs, energy meters and a range of other DIN- and panel-mounted communications devices.
